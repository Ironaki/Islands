# Islands 🚴⛰🌊🏁

## Introduction


## Demo

## Run Project

``` sh

yarn run server
```


```sh
# Or with npm
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run server
```

View Islands in the browser at http://localhost:8000

Running in this environment provides hot reloading and support for routing; just edit and save the file and the browser will automatically refresh. To use a port other than 8000 set the `PORT` environment variable (`PORT=8080 npm run server`).
