# Islands üö¥‚õ∞üåäüèÅ

## Introduction

Islands is a shortest path finder in 2D grid. 

There are three types of element in the grid.
- Road, light grey. Cost 1
- Slope/Hill/Mountain, darker grey (occassionaly ‚õ∞). Cost 4
- Water, blue (occasionaly üåä) . Impassable

Valid directions are up, left, right, down. No diagnoal moving.

`Find Path` founds the path from start to end that minimizes the cost. Path is shown in light green. If there's no path, nothing is shown.

Each element in the grid could be toggled when clicking on it, provided that `Find Path` is not enabled. `Clear path` before edit the grid.

`Set Start` and `Set End` enables setting of start point and goal. Click on a element that is not water will set the start or end point.

`Set World` enables setting of the grid. Minimun of 3 X 3 and maximum of 96 X 54 grid is allowed. Possible type of grid initiation are Blank (all road), Random and Tokyo Bay (initial). If you wounder why it's called Tokyo Bay, it's my best attempt to reproduce contour of Tokyo Bay on a 2D grid.  [Take a look on Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6438476,139.7549966,13.81z) More on why I choose Tokyo Bay in Inspiration section.


## Demo

## Run Project

``` sh
yarn install
yarn start
# in another tab
yarn run server
```


```sh
# Or with npm
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run server
```

View Islands in the browser at http://localhost:8000

Running in this environment provides hot reloading and support for routing; just edit and save the file and the browser will automatically refresh. To use a port other than 8000 set the `PORT` environment variable (`PORT=8080 npm run server`).


## Algorithm

[A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), Manhattan distance used for heuristic. The more well-known Dijkstra's algorithm is special case of A* with 0 heuristic.

## Inspiration

When the project is first conceived, I planed to build a shortest path finder for a boat to travel between islands. This is a boring scenario. If all elements in the grid has same cost for traversing, then BFS(bread first search) will be adequate for this purpose, although Dijkstra's and A* will still be faster.

A new scenario is for a person on bike to find a easy path. As a casual cyclist myself, maybe too casual to even be called a cyclist :) , I'm quite averse to slopes. One of my favorite route in Tokyo travels around man-made islands, (Odaiba, Ariake, Toyosu, to name a few). Roads are good, and traffic is few on these islands. This is the reason that I still name this project islands. 

Living in southern Tokyo, to get to these islands, I need to travel across Minato ward, which is famous for it's slopes. Here's Minato-ku's website: [A lot of the places are named Saka ÂùÇ (slope) in Minato](https://www.city.minato.tokyo.jp/kyouikucenter/kodomo/kids/machinami/saka/index.html). To avoid these slopes, I usually ride east first, and travel along the coast north to Tsukiji or Ginza, then go to the islands. (BTW, You cannot biking across Rainbow bridge, thus it's impassable on the grid. Technically you can walk your bike across it, but that's not really interesting.)

Why is the cost of slope 4? In a 3 X 3 grid, if there's a slope in the middle, I would take the detour. If cost of slope is 3, then travelling through the slope would make no difference to the detour.
